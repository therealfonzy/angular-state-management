# Structure of the Routing, Pages, Etc.

Within an application, which is:

- inside the `/projects/apps` directory
- something you can "run" (e.g. `ng serve`)

The `app` folder serves as the "shell" for the application.

On the left navigation sidebar, it shows links for each feature (called a "Domain" here).

In the `app.routes.ts` you import each "domain" in order that
you want them to appear on the sidebar.

## Shell `@app-ui/application/shell` as `ui-application-shell`

## Features

### `ui-feature-shell`
