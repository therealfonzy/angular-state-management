# Scaffolding

## Scaffolding a Domain

In the root of this project, run:

```sh
 ./scripts/create-domain.sh domain-name project-name
```

Where `domain-name` is the name of the new domain you want to create, and `project-name` is the project in the `projects` folder.

> Note: It has you do a git commit before in case you mess up. Not that I would ever do that. ;)
